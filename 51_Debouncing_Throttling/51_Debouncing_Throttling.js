/* Debouncing and Throttling concepts are used for optimizing and performance of web app

it can be done by limiting the rate of or execution of a particular function or (function calls) 

Ex- 1.fetching the data form API, logging anything on loggers


Debouncing
----------------------
if the time difference between two key stroke events is greater than (the time you set i,e 3 seconds) then the function call is executed

Throttling
------------------
Here the function call is executed after the set time is expired (say 3 seconds). so for every 3 seconds the function call is executed. so it's like calling function after certain invterval of time
